Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of K-means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and other relevant features. Customer segmentation helps businesses to identify distinct groups within their customer base and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

Introduction
Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing analytics. By grouping customers into segments based on similar characteristics, businesses can develop targeted marketing campaigns, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately increase revenue. In this project, we use K-means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to perform customer segmentation.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes customer data with features such as:

Age
Gender
Annual Income
Spending Score
Other relevant features (e.g., purchase frequency, loyalty points)
You can download the dataset from [cb1222e506c1266b9cc808143ddbab82-b2fe8213426159be7f9c8de108726d3d814153eb\mall_customers.csv].
Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with several libraries. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation-kmeans.git
cd customer-segmentation-kmeans

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
1. Preprocess the data:

Clean and normalize the data.
Handle missing values, if any.
Perform feature scaling.
2. Run the K-means clustering algorithm:

Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
Apply K-means clustering to segment the customers.
3. Analyze the clusters:

Visualize the clusters using plots.
Interpret the characteristics of each cluster.
You can run the provided Jupyter notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb to see the full implementation and analysis.

Results :-
The results section includes:

<1> Optimal number of clusters determined by the Elbow method.
<2> Visualizations of the clusters (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts).
<3> Description and interpretation of each customer segment.
